## 1. Data acquisition

The dataset used in this project is **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**,
available on Kaggle.

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
- **Problem type:** Regression
- **Target variable:** SalePrice

The dataset is provided by Kaggle in two separate files:
- `train.csv`: contains the input features and the target variable (`SalePrice`)
- `test.csv`: contains only the input features (no target variable)

In this project, only `train.csv` is used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
The Kaggle `test.csv` file is not used for model evaluation because it does not contain
the target variable. Model evaluation is performed using an internal train/test split
on `train.csv`.

The raw data files are stored in the following directory:
